1. The terminal is a place on your computer where you can directly communicate with your computer and Git. 

2. The major difference between GitHub and Git is that GitHub you can share and easily view repositories, while with Git, it is much harder to look at and search though.

3. Click on the CODE button on the repo that you want to fork, and copy the clone link. In your terminal, use " git clone" and then paste the link you copied. Use "cd" to enter the file and use "mkdir" to create a new file, or you can use "touch" to add something to this file. Use "git status" to see how things are looking, and then use "git add" + the file you want to add. After this, you can commit using "git commit -m """, and don't forget to add your message. After committing, you can then finally use "git push origin main" to push to the repo.
